# Flask-login-API
A Flask API to facilitate logging users into a website by providing and using tokens

I have a few projects in mind that would benefit from a login system to facilitate handeling data for multiple people. This is a basic Flask api that handles users and provides tokens so that access to data can be provided.
In subsiquent projects this will be used as the basis for the back end.
